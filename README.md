# The Flavor DB
Work in Progress

Full stack application that helps cooks and chefs spark their creativity and imaginations by pairing flavors together. Users can save their generated flavor combinations into Pairings on their profile with pictures and notes. Other users may comment on or like community generated Pairings. The data for this project is from the book 'The Flavor Bible' by Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS, Passport

Built with MVC architechure with a backed using Node, Express and Server Generated Pages with EJS. Front end done with Tailwind for style and Passport for authentication. 

## Optimizations
Since this is a work in progress there are still many features and bugs to iron out. Please visit the issues section if you would like to know the specifics. 

## Lessons Learned:
-MVC architecture for backend seperations of concerns has been great for organization and debugging. 
-First time working with EJS for embedding JS and I'm really enjoying it, although I wish I had leared a little React before this I might have tried to build the whole thing with React. I may refactor it all into React later as an excersie. 
-First time using Tailwind and I find it's a balacing act between the efficiency of creating layouts quickly, and fighting against it trying to make things pixel perfect.
